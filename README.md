# No-nonsense YT time-stamper!

**POV:** You're watching YouTube. It's a 2-hour long video. There's an interesting part starting at 1:20 you wanna share with your friends.

**But:** You're using the mobile app! (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  *"There's no EZ way to put the 1:20 timestamp"* you scream.

No worries. *Now* there is ;)
